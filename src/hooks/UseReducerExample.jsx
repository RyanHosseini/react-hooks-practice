/*
 * useReducer hook is an alternative instead of using useState
 * useReducer hook is similar to Redux which is a state management tool,
 * useRedcuer is made of three parts: 1. reducer 2. action 3. store
 *** 1. reducer: they're functions! what do they do? They actually handle the state depending on what we want,
 *** 2. action: an object that we send (dispatch) to reducer functions to do something (properties: type [implements on state], payload [value]),
 *** 3. store: a place in which state stores there, so it actually stores the state.
